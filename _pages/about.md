I am an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Nevada Reno. My academic background is in civil engineering, and I was primarily trained as a computational solid mechanics and geotechnical earthquake engineer. However, my research interests lay at the intersection of engineering and science, reaching across fields of geotechnical and structural engineering, earth sciences, computational mechanics, and applied mathematics and statistics. As an educator and mentor, I am interested in helping students equip themselves with the skill sets they need to live their professional dreams.

My Research
======
My research focuses on developing and utilizing rigorous physics-based learning, modeling, and uncertainty quantification methodologies in geostructures and geophysics applications to understand better the built environmentâ€™s interaction with the earthquake hazard taking interdependencies and uncertainties into account. 


My Background
======
I hold a Ph.D. in civil engineering (2016) from the University of California, Los Angeles, an M.S. in earthquake engineering (2009), and a B.S. in civil engineering (2007) from the Sharif University of Technology, Iran. Before joining UNR, I was a postdoctoral scholar at the California Institute of Technology (2017-2019).
