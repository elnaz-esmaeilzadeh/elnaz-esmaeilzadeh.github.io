I am an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Nevada Reno. My academic background is in civil engineering, and I was primarily trained as a computational solid mechanics and geotechnical earthquake engineer. However, my research interests lay at the intersection of engineering and science, reaching across fields of geotechnical and structural engineering, earth sciences, computational mechanics, and applied mathematics and statistics. As an educator and mentor, I am interested in helping students equip themselves with the skill sets they need to live their professional dreams.

My Research
======
My research focuses on developing rigorous frameworks and methodologies to enable and accelerate physics-based learning, modeling, and uncertainty quantification in geosystems. Broadly, my research seeks to achieve the synergy among mechanistic modeling, distributed sensing, scientific machine learning, and high-performance computing to understand better the built environmentâ€™s interaction with natural and man-made hazards taking interdependencies and uncertainties into account. Such discoveries can be used subsequently to devise and train physics-based models for engineering applications from design to decision making. Currently, I am working on:

- Deep learning based surrogate modeling for uncertainty quantification in soil-structure interaction problems
- Distributed acoustic sensing for subsurface monitoring and characterization
- Shallow crust characterization and modeling in broad-band linear and nonliear deterministic ground motion simulations
- Meta-foundation based seismic wave attenuation and manipulation

I am one of the developers of seismo-VLAB, an open-source finite element software for meso-scale wave propagation simulation in soil-structure interaction problems. For more details, please check the [software website](https://seismovlab.com).


My Background
======
I hold a Ph.D. in civil engineering (2016) from the University of California, Los Angeles, an M.S. in earthquake engineering (2009), and a B.S. in civil engineering (2007) from the Sharif University of Technology, Iran. Before joining UNR, I was a postdoctoral scholar at the California Institute of Technology (2017-2019).
